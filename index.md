At Countering Disinformation, we engage in critical discussions to understand what's actually happening around us.

True and accurate information in today's society can be concealed under **many** layers.

- Complete lies: Social Media is an easy way for individuals to spread false information.

- Half Truths: Person A sneaks a kiss with Person B. Depending on whether they are in a relationship or not, this half truth has completely different implications.

- Exaggerated truths: Yellow Journalism was prevalent during the Gilded Age and still is today, due to the rise in social media.
