<p>At Countering Disinformation, we engage in critical discussions to understand what&#8217;s actually happening around us.</p>
<p>True and accurate information in today&#8217;s society can be concealed under <strong>many</strong> layers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Complete lies: Social Media is an easy way for individuals to spread false information.</p></li>
<li><p>Half Truths: Person A sneaks a kiss with Person B. Depending on whether they are in a relationship or not, this half truth has completely different implications.</p></li>
<li><p>Exaggerated truths: Yellow Journalism was prevalent during the Gilded Age and still is today, due to the rise in social media.</p></li>
</ul>
